                  of Memory-Constrained Embedded Systems},

  abstract = {Event-driven programming is a popular model for
                  writing programs for tiny embedded systems and
                  sensor network nodes. While event-driven programming
                  can keep the memory overhead down, it enforces a
                  state machine programming style which makes many
                  programs difficult to write, maintain, and debug. We
                  present a novel programming abstraction called
                  protothreads that makes it possible to write
                  event-driven programs in a thread-like style, with a
                  memory overhead of only two bytes per
                  protothread. We show that protothreads significantly
                  reduce the complexity of a number of widely used
                  programs previously written with event-driven state
                  machines. For the examined programs the majority of
                  the state machines could be entirely removed. In the
                  other cases the number of states and transitions was
                  drastically decreased. With protothreads the number
                  of lines of code was reduced by one third. The
                  execution time overhead of protothreads is on the
                  order of a few processor cycles.},
